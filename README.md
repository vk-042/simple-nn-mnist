# 🧠 Simple Neural Network from Scratch (MNIST Digit Classification)

This project implements a simple neural network **from scratch using NumPy**, trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0–9). No high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used.

## 🚀 Overview
- Pure NumPy-based implementation
- Implements core neural network concepts:
  - Forward propagation
  - Softmax activation
  - One-hot encoding
  - Batch training
  - Model evaluation

## 📊 Results
Achieved over **90% accuracy** on the MNIST test set using:
- 1 hidden layer
- ReLU activation
- Manual vectorized training loop

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `Simple Neural Network.ipynb` – Core notebook
- `README.md` – Project description

## 📦 Installation & Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vk-042/simple-nn-mnist.git
